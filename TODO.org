* notes
maybe have a stack of compilers? can push/pop...
have each compiler pass output to previous one in the stack

how to represent U32 and U64?

how will we pass callbacks through to the VM?  e.g. if I want to map
values of a ht?  safe to 'just' push a stack frame?  but how do we
yield control to the vm, and get it back?

RE: storing image data off-heap: could have a 'byte-blob' object type.
after a gc, scan the old heap for byte-blobs that are not broken hearts,
and free the mem. it's a tradeoff, two heap scans, but less copying.
could become important as there will eventually be many images

RE: meta, would be nice if could have `contextual` in-expr meta, so
that the meta runtime could `push` and `pop` match systems:

(define (copy-from-to a b)
  (let ((i 0))
    (while (< i (length a))
      ;; here we push the `idx` reader which adds supports for subscripts
      ;; for a single expression
      #m idx (set! b[i] i[i])
      (set! i (+ 1 i)))))

(this is actually spelled out in the ometa paper)

also would be nice to add support for arguments, as is done in OMeta
and col/line error reporting :P

need to learn about hygienic macro expansion
need to learn about scm module systems? it looks like racket has a nice one.

I have also been thinking about how to make lisp programs objects.
I want them to respond to messages.

I am wondering if the program should be 'instantiated' or are they
singletons?  it would be a bit hard to know how to parse/update the
class from the editor, or maybe I'm overthinking it?

So a Program would have some sort of contructor (or maybe a couple)
and some way of exporting function/macro/etc definitions (like a map)
wondering if the object model could have any object provide a symbol
namespace in addition to a messaging namespace, which I find
intriguing... but need to learn more about racket modules first I
think.

How will Programs refer to each other? Define as inputs, but how will
the reference be written?

I really like the simplicity of defmacro style macros, but without
symbol packages, or lisp2 namespaces they are a bit troublesome. I'm
not sure how to make defmacro work sensibly with a module system
either.

It sounds like the scheme community hasn't decided on a way to handle
this yet either... syntax-case seems like a good bet (although it was
withdrawn?) maybe should just look into how racket does it, but that
is likely way more complicated than needed, due to all the other stuff
racket does around language support.
